                        <p>It's annoying to need get used to the 21st century. We've come a long way since rotary phones and Rolodexes. I wouldn't know about it but I still have to get used to it.</p>

                        <p>If I may break into an analogy here, on one of those park rides that lifts you up 400 feet and drops you, when you reach the bottom, you don't crash into the ground. You decelerate and then you come to a full stop.</p>

                        <p>It's so you don't die.</p>

                        <p>A battery doesn't want to die (literally no-longer able to be charged. dead dead.). There is general rule that batteries should be charged between 40% and 80%. This means you charge the device up to 80%, let it drain to 40%, rinse and repeat.</p>

                        <p>Modern devices have implemented this feature in the background, too. When your phone's battery percentage reads "100%," the battery isn't literally 100% full.</p>

                        <p>And so that is what I have been doing. Of course, if I need a full charge for the day, I'll hit 100% so it lasts longer. I guess that is another take-away from this; technically, you will not have as much energy. Your device will thank you, though!</p>
