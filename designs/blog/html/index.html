                        <p>Five years after announcing we’d bring Google Fiber to Kansas City, our vision remains: to connect more people to superfast and abundant Internet. At that time, Gigabit residential speeds were unheard of, built-from-the-ground-up Fiberhood designs and builds were as yet unproven, and a great customer experience simply didn’t exist. Since then, we have reshaped the landscape — these innovations are becoming more commonplace (which we all can agree is great for everyone, particularly for consumers!).</p>

                        <p>And thanks to the hard work of everyone on the Access team, our business is solid: our subscriber base and revenue are growing quickly, and we expect that growth to continue. I am extremely proud of what we’ve built together in five short years.</p>

                        <p>Now, just as any competitive business must, we have to continue not only to grow, but also stay ahead of the curve — pushing the boundaries of technology, business, and policy — to remain a leader in delivering superfast Internet. We have refined our plan going forward to achieve these objectives. It entails us making changes to focus our business and product strategy. Importantly, the plan enhances our focus on new technology and deployment methods to make superfast Internet more abundant than it is today.</p>

                        <p>These changes to our business and technology will have some immediate implications. Some of our efforts will remain unchanged, but others will be impacted. In terms of our existing footprint, in the cities where we’ve launched or are under construction, our work will continue. For most of our “<a href="https://fiber.google.com/newcities/#viewcities">potential Fiber cities</a>” — those where we’ve been in exploratory discussions — we’re going to pause our operations and offices while we refine our approaches. We’re ever grateful to these cities for their ongoing partnership and patience, and we’re confident we’ll have an opportunity to resume our partnership discussions once we’ve advanced our technologies and solutions. In this handful of cities that are still in an exploratory stage, and in certain related areas of our supporting operations, we’ll be reducing our employee base.</p>

                        <p>As for me personally, it’s been quite a journey over the past few years, taking a broad-based set of projects and initiatives and growing a focused business that is on a strong trajectory. And I’ve decided this is the right juncture to step aside from my CEO role. Larry has asked me to continue as an advisor, so I’ll still be around.</p>

                        <p>I am humbled by our growth and progress across Access today, and I’m so grateful to have been part of such an extraordinary bet. And as we continue this bet, I remain confident that the future will hold a much more connected society and abundant access for all. Let’s keep doing our part to make it so!</p>

                    <div class="post-body">
                        <p>Hello there. My name is Zak Nesler. I am a sixteen year old who loves to write code. I had started to do this when I was in middle school; ever since then, I have been addicted to it. It all started out with some basic HTML and CSS. From that point, I started to learn Batch, Lua following suit. After a while of playing around with those languages, I took an interest in back-end web development.</p>

                        <p>I roughly taught myself PHP at the beginning, after which I discovered <a href="https://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. I learned more about PHP there, as well as improving my knowledge with HTML and CSS. In addition to that, I also learned some Ruby and Python. PHP was definitely the language that stuck with me, though.</p>

                        <p>Shortly after that, I happened upon <a href="https://www.codecourse.com">Codecourse</a> (formerly phpacademy). If you may permit to me a plug: the creator of Codecourse, Alex Garrett, provides very professional and extremely easy-to-follow tutorials. I learned a lot more about PHP, and just about every language pertinent to web-development, just by watching and following along with his videos. In addition to that, he also led me on to Laravel.</p>

                        <p>Laravel—a PHP framework—always was a confusing and daunting thing that I tried my absolute hardest to avoid. Every time I saw the word "Laravel," I shivered because I was so scared (exaggerating). It took me the longest time to get myself to watch something Laravel-esque. When I did, however, I realized that it was possibly the greatest thing since—bad joke incoming—sliced bread.</p>

                        <p>In addition to learning Laravel from Codecourse, and of course reading its documentation, I learned a large amount from <a href="https://laracasts.com">Laracasts</a>. It has literal tons (okay, maybe not literal) of tutorials that were created by Jeffery Way. With these three resources, I mastered Laravel in only a few months. If you are interested in Laravel, I recommend that you do, too.</p>

                        <p>Well I think that I have talked too much about myself. I want to hear about you, now. I would love to see projects that you have created or websites that you are proud of. Send me a message <a href="https://zaknesler.com/contact">here</a> and I will get back to you as soon as I can. I promise!</p>
